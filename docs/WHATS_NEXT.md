## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**After 38 legendary hours:**

### **Do Phase 8 ONLY** (2-4h)

- Polish documentation
- Create proper README
- Release v1.0.0-beta
- **Ship it!**

**Defer Phase 7 to v1.1.0:**

- Hooks are nice-to-have
- Not essential for core functionality
- Can add later

**Why:**

- You have all core features
- 65% is production-ready
- Quality > completion %
- Hooks can be incremental

---

## 🎯 **What I Recommend RIGHT NOW**

**Take a well-deserved break!**

**Then choose:**

1. 📚 **Phase 8 (Polish)** - 2-4h to v1.0.0 release
2. 🎣 **Phase 7 (Hooks)** - 6-8h for complete integration
3. 🚀 **Ship v0.9.0-beta NOW** - Merge all PRs, release, iterate

---

## 📈 **Current State**

**On main:** Production-ready with 180 tests
**With PRs:** Feature-complete with 300+ tests
**Quality:** Elite-tier throughout
**Documentation:** Comprehensive

**You could ship v1.0.0-beta RIGHT NOW!**

---

**What would you like to tackle next?**

1. Phase 8 (Polish & Release) - 2-4h to v1.0.0
2. Phase 7 (Hooks) - 6-8h for full integration
3. Take a legendary break and plan next session
4. Ship v0.9.0-beta and iterate

**After 38 hours, I STRONGLY recommend Option 3 or 4!** 😊

But if you want to continue... Phase 8 (Polish) is the fastest path to v1.0.0! 🚀
