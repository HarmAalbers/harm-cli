## 🤖 Phase 4: Goal-AI Integration (Complete)

### What Was Built

#### 1. Core Module (`lib/goal_ai.sh`)

**AI Analysis Functions:**

- `goal_ai_analyze(goal_id)` - Analyze complexity, break into subtasks, validate time estimates
- `goal_ai_plan(goal_id)` - Generate step-by-step implementation plans
- `goal_ai_next()` - Smart next-action suggestions based on urgency, dependencies, progress
- `goal_ai_check_completion(goal_id)` - Verify completion criteria with AI

**Claude Code Integration:**

- `goal_ai_create_context()` - Generate `goals-context.md` for Claude Code
- Auto-includes active goals, plans, GitHub context
- Updates automatically on goal progress

**GitHub Integration:**

- `goal_ai_link_github(goal_id, issue_number)` - Link goals to GitHub issues
- `goal_ai_sync_github(goal_id)` - Sync goal status with GitHub
- Auto-extract issue numbers from goal text (`#42` pattern)
- Fetch issue details, comments, labels

#### 2. CLI Commands (`bin/harm-cli`)

**Basic Commands (Enhanced):**

```bash
harm-cli goal set "Complete Phase 4" 4h
harm-cli goal show
harm-cli goal progress 1 50
harm-cli goal complete 1
harm-cli goal clear --force
```

**AI-Powered Commands (NEW):**

```bash
harm-cli goal ai-analyze 1      # AI analyzes goal complexity

harm-cli goal ai-next           # Suggest what to work on next
harm-cli goal ai-check 1        # Verify completion criteria
harm-cli goal ai-context        # Generate Claude Code context
```

**GitHub Integration (NEW):**

```bash
harm-cli goal link-github 1 42  # Link goal #1 to issue #42
harm-cli goal sync-github 1     # Sync status with GitHub
```

#### 3. AI-Powered Features

**Goal Analysis:**

- Complexity assessment (1-10 scale)
- Subtask breakdown (3-7 actionable items)
- Time estimate validation
- Prerequisites & dependencies identification
- Success criteria definition

**Implementation Planning:**

- Preparation steps (setup, research)
- Step-by-step implementation (<2 hours each)
- Testing strategy for each step
- Rollback plan
- Success verification

**Smart Suggestions:**

- Prioritization by urgency, dependencies, progress
- Energy-level matching

- Markdown formatted for AI consumption

**Location:** `~/.harm-cli/claude-context/goals-context.md`

**Usage:**

```bash
# Generate context
harm-cli goal ai-context

# Claude Code can then read this file to understand:
# - What you're working on
# - Implementation plans
# - GitHub issue details
# - Next suggested actions
```

#### 5. GitHub Issue Linking

**Auto-Detection:**
Goals can reference issues directly:

```bash
harm-cli goal set "#42 Fix login bug" 2h
# Automatically detects and links to issue #42
```

**AI Plan Enhancement:**
When linked to GitHub:

- AI includes issue title, labels, description in planning
- Context-aware implementation suggestions
- Issue-specific testing strategies

**Status Syncing:**

```bash
# Sync goal progress to GitHub issue comments
harm-cli goal sync-github 1
```
